# DAETOOLS EXTENDED

Daetools is a Equation-based Object-oriented modelling, simulation, and optimisation software.

The proposed extension of the main classes of DAETOOLS aims to permit:
* the use of an input json file in order to permite the reuse and the parametrization of the models.
* a graph-based model approach model describe in the json input file.
* the use of a json output of one simulation as initial estimates of a second simulation.
